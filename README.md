# SIDEARM Sports Full-Stack Test

Things this test *_is_*:
* A chance for us to get to see how you approach solving problems

Things this test *_is not_*:
* A graded measure of your Node/Express/Programming skills
* A real example of day-to-day work

Scenario:

1. The `schedules list view` isn't showing all the columns it should.
2. When clicking on the View button from the `schedules list view` the `schedule detail view` is throwing a stack trace.
3. Both views are plain looking, add some Bootstrap to make them more readable.

Navigate over the the schedules page and see if you can solve the problem.
